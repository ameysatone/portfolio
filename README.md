Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website serves as a showcase for my work, skills, and projects as a web developer. It includes a contact form where users can send inquiries directly to me. Below is all the information you need to understand, install, and contribute to this project.

## Features

- **Contact Form:** Users can send a message to me directly (the EmailJS integration for the contact form is planned and will be integrated soon).
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Personalized Content:** The portfolio includes sections about me, my skills, projects, and an easy way for potential clients, employers, or collaborators to get in touch.
